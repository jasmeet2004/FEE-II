        <h3>About the book:- </h3>
        <p>Target 3 Billion: Innovative Solutions Towards Sustainable Development talks about the 3 billion people across the globe who live in villages and are often deprived of basic resources. The authors explain how the global model of development has failed to eradicate poverty.

            India's 750 million people living in villages constitutes the world's largest rural population. Target 3 Billion: Innovative Solutions Towards Sustainable Development integrates the challenges and opportunities of the present human civilization. It elaborates on providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA), a sustainable and environment friendly system that will uplift the rural masses. Instead of relying on government subsidies, Dr. Kalam says that entrepreneurship with community participation can empower villagers. PURA is a blend of people, technology, entrepreneurial spirit, traditions and skills. Readers will come across many examples throughout the book which demonstrate how PURA can change the lives of millions. Some of these include Seed Club at Chitrakoot Pura and Warana Cooperative Sugar Factory.
            
            Target 3 Billion: Innovative Solutions Towards Sustainable Development explains how governments can use this system for the benefit of the rural masses. Some of the chapters in this book include The Other Half of Mankind, Effecting A Social Transformation and Agriculture and PURA. The authors have posed the question, what can I do to empower 3 billion? The answers have been provided from the different perspectives of citizens, students and senior citizens. This book was published by Penguin India in 2011, is available in paperback.</p>
